Not all 160 features are needed, so need to clean the dataset by removing some column. For example, columns with NA values, DIV/0, empty columns, and column with people names that is not correlated with the expected predicted classes.

The goal of this project to predict the the manner of people did during exercise using data from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
#Preparing the Data (Data Cleaning)
###Training Dataset
The training dataset is from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv.
There are 19622 rows of training datasets, which means there are 19622 dataset for training, with 160 variables (or features).
###Testing dataset
The testing dataset is from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
There are 20 rows of datasets, which means there are 20 dataset for training, with 160 variables (or features).
This project will partition the training dataset into 70% for training, and 30% for validation on creating the machine learning model.
Not all 160 features are needed, so need to clean the dataset by removing some column. For example, columns with NA values, DIV/0, empty columns, and column with people names that is not correlated with the expected predicted classes.

This project will partition the training dataset into 70% for training, and 30% for validation on creating the machine learning model.
Not all 160 features are needed, so we need to clean the dataset by removing some columns. For example, columns with NA values, DIV/0, empty columns, and column with people names that is not correlated with the expected predicted classes.

cleanpmltest<-pmlTest[,names(cleanpmlTrain[,-52])]
dim(cleanpmltest)
```
The training dataset into 70% for training, and 30% for validation on creating the machine learning model, using these codes:
```{r}
#Create Partition
library(caret)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=cleanpmlTrain$classe, p=0.70,list=F)
training<-cleanpmlTrain[inTrain,]
validate<-cleanpmlTrain[-inTrain,]
#Training and validate set dimensions
dim(training)
dim(validate)
```
##Training
Random forest trees were generated for the training dataset using cross-validation. Then the generated algorithm was examnined under the partitioned training set to examine the accuracy and estimated error of prediction. By using 51 predictors for five classes using cross-validation at a 5-fold an accuracy of 99.2% with a 95% CI [0.989-0.994] was achieved accompanied by a Kappa value of 0.99.
